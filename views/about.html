            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
              My self Pavneet Kaur. I would like to introduce my self as future
              <em>Web Developer</em> and currently studying
              <a href="https://www.senecacollege.ca/programs/fulltime/CPP.html"
                >Computer Programming</a
              >
              at
              <a href="https://www.senecacollege.ca/home.html"
                >Seneca College, Toronto</a
              >
              as full time student. Basically, I am from Punjab, INDIA. But for
              achieving my goal and becoming a <em>Front-End Developer</em> I
              temporarily moved to Canada. Also reason behind studying here in
              Canada is that Seneca College was my dream college and I always
              wanted to come here and study for my dream. As I already
              introduced myself as <em>Web Developer</em>, my hobbies are
              coding, studying more about programming languages and making mini-
              web projects, and Obviously my dream is to become Web Developer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently, I am in third semester of my program and till now I
              have studied Basic C, C++, Javascript, HTML, and Oracle. Along
              with that I have studied Applied Problem Solving, Data
              Communication and Unix-Linux Introduction. But from all these
              fields studying web development i.e, javascript and HTML is most
              interesting for me. I never get bored when I am studying this
              subject, I never get tired when I am doing assignments of this
              subject. But studying C and C++ always remained a burden for me.
              So I always have to spend more than enough time on these two
              programming languages. But I always see my future in web
              Development I will definitly do that.
            </p>

            <p>
              If I talk about the projects which I am doing or I have done as
              part of my assignments, I created an HR application which deals
              with oracle database using C++ code, I created my own website
              about an animal with additional links to other websites and many
              more. Link to all those projects is
              <a href=" https://github.com/pavneet-kaur1"> My Github Account</a
              >. I am working on many more projects. I will be posting all those
              projects on my account too.
